"Quiet, The Winter Harbor",Mazzy Star,"well youre still walking
around the block
you had a long time
to think who you are
you look so sad
well so you think
you say come over
and youre still a star
youre like a villain
in some old film
walking in the dark
in somebodys room
save me
cause im still sinking
and youve got a harbor
close to the shore
simple
your thoughts are swimming
id like to see them
when youre alone
youve got the same smile
you had before
its just lighter
and what i adore
e
save me
cause im still sinking
and youve got a harbor
close to the shored
"
Rainbow River,Vashti Bunyan,"the rainbow river is a laughing stream
down in a valley by a mountain that is pine tree tall
the rainbow river has a small boy fishing
with a worm and a jam jar by the waterfall
dont make a sound dont disturb the ground
the biggest fish you ever saw is around
and the rainbow river gives a rainbow fish
as one small boy goes running proudly to his mothers call
the stonebuilt farmhouse is a rough stone cottage
hiding close against the hillside up a winding track
the stonebuilt farmhouse has a fairhaired farmer
wearing wooden shoes and building up a new haystack
run in the door stand on the stone floor
the oven opens theres the biggest loaf you ever saw
and the stonebuilt farmhouse gives a good warm welcome
as he sits down in his armchair with a windsor back
the magpie meadow is a glowing evening
colour sun is setting quietly and the boy is tired
the magpie meadow has a sparrow hawk
who hovers hanging on the wind preying eagleeyed
sit by the lantern watch as the years turn
slowly bringing truth for every child to learn
and the magpie meadow darkens gently blue now
as the family sit their faces lit by ember fireed
"
Swallow Song,Vashti Bunyan,"and theres a sunset brimming over the sky
and theres a swallow teaching its young how to fly
up on high see how fast the summer passes by
and theres an oak leaf turning green into brown
and theres a pine so proud of her evergreen gown
looking down see how fast the winter comes around
and theres a rain cloud passing over our heads
and theres a cat on the doorstep waiting to be fed
milk and bread day is done and now its time for beded
"
Timothy Grub,Vashti Bunyan,"maurice snail and timothy grub
swanney and blue and emily grub
decided one day to go into the wood
and build them a house and live there if they could
and they stayed there a while in the trees and the rain
till one day two blue men said youre all insane
and to please not come here again
they had a green car called happiness runs
friday comes and happiness runs
out of petrol and everyone gets out to push
and suddenly see through a gap in the bush
a real caravan just like the one in their dreams
the gypsy doesnt want it for nowadays it seems
his home stays in one place and gleams
he told them that he had a horse down the lane
saturday morning they went back again
he showed them a shed that was built out of tin
he opened the door and they all peered within
and there lying in straw was a horse black as night
with a star on her forehead and eyes full of light
and they all fell in love at first sight
e
they thought and they thought about having black bess
timothy planted some mustard and cress
they lived in a cupboard and made it their home
and lay there and dreamed of the days when theyd roam
up and down all the hills of the north countryside
with the dogs eating buttercups on the wayside
and theyd wave all the cities goodbyed
"
Lily Pond,Vashti Bunyan,"in a lily pond i lay
all upon a summers day
then i chased a dragonfly
all across an ancient sky
falling with a thousand stars
down the milky way to mars
back again in time for day
in a lily pond i lay
the only thing he said to me
was young lady i love thee
in a lily pond i lay
all upon a summers day
then i chased a dragonfly
all across an ancient sky
falling with a thousand stars
down the milky way to mars
back again in time for day
in a lily pond i layed

Frozen Laughter,The Rising Storm,"honey is that you

shadows in the nighttime
through my dimly lit mind
when
my heart begins to wander
my thoughts go far beyond her
ahhahhahhahhoh

thought that i could love her
but then i couldnt

in the shade of laughter
my crumbling soul blows past her
a drunken filter hides her face
in
the room where men commandco
talking of michelangelo

What Comes After Certainty,Bill Callahan,"true love is not magic
its certainty
and what comes after certainty
a world of mystery
i stood on the surf in kauai
while my love videoed me
on honeymoon
the passenger is the driver in ecstasy
and gods face on the water
though plain to see
its still hard to read
well i never thought id make it this far
little old house recentmodel car
and i got the woman of my dreams
and an imitation eames
and i signed willies guitar
he sang hey good lookin what you got cookin
and i signed willies guitar when he wasnt looking
well i dont believe in fate
i believe in destiny
whoa my destiny is swerving in the road in front me drunkenly
when you take responsibility for your own divinity
true love is not magic
its certainty

My Grandfather's Clock,John Fahey,"my grandfathers clock was too large for the shelf
so it stood ninety years on the floor
it was taller by half than the old man himself
though it weighed not a pennyweight more
it was bought on the morn of the day that he was born
and was always his treasure and pride
but it stopped short never to go again
when the old man died
ninety years without slumbering
his life seconds numbering
it stopped short never to go again
when the old man died
my grandfather said that of those he could hire
not a servant so faithful he found
for it wasted no time and had but one desire
at the close of each week to be wound
and it kept in its place not a frown upon its face
and its hands never hung by its side
but it stopped short never to go again
when the old man died
it rang and alarmed in the dead of the night
an alarm that for years had been dumb
and we knew that his spirit was pluming for flight
that his hour for departure had come
still the clock kept the time with a soft and muffled chime
as we silently stood by his side
but it stopped short never to go again
when the old man died
eninety years without slumbering
his life seconds numbering
it stopped short never to go again
when the old man diedd

I Love You Like An Alcoholic,The Taxpayers,"heavy humid night corner of park and main
cast that first glance your smile my veins
at maximum capacity blood pumping so fast
my girl if looks gave heart attacks
the dangerous men in the shadows were like an audience and even the meanest among them had a special little shine in their eyes when they saw us walk by
walked about twenty blocks talking about good bars and better towns than this one
kissed that first night and then the rain opened up the sky to get
one last kiss i love you like an alcoholic
one last kiss i love you like a statuette
one last kiss i need you like i need a broken leg
i was getting off the late shift
attempting to recover
crumpled up the bus pass
tossed it into the gutter
some handsome dark stranger
you were standing there on the corner
you had those compelling magnetized eyes you must have lost when you got older
seven blocks in my fingers brushed your hand
i blushed and you laughed but you seemed a little sad
i aint one to jump a ship but i absolutely knew
i was six steps in when i fell into you
e
one last kiss i love you like a broken pot
one last kiss i love you like a pack of dogs
one last kiss i need you like i need a gaping head wound

Suzanne,Hope Sandoval & The Warm Inventions,"suzanne takes you down
to her place near the river
you can hear the boats go by
you can spend the night beside her
and you know that shes halfcrazy
but thats why you want to be there
and she feeds you tea and oranges
that come all the way from china
and just when you mean to tell her
that you have no love to give her
then she gets you on her wavelength
and she lets the river answer
that youve always been her lover
and you want to travel with her
and you want to travel blind
and you know that she will trust you
for youve touched her perfect body with your mind
and jesus was a sailor
when he walked upon the water
and he spent a long time watching
from his lonely wooden tower
and when he knew for certain
only drowning men could see him
he said all men will be sailors then
until the sea shall free them
but he himself was broken
long before the sky would open
forsaken almost human
he sank beneath your wisdom like a stone
e
and you want to travel with him
and you want to travel blind
and you think maybe youll trust him
for hes touched your perfect body with his mind
now suzanne takes your hand
and she leads you to the river
she is wearing rags and feathers
from salvation army counters
and the sun pours down like honey
on our lady of the harbour
and she shows you where to look
among the garbage and the flowers
there are heroes in the seaweed
there are children in the morning
they are leaning out for love
and they will lean that way forever
while suzanne holds the mirror
and you want to travel with her
and you want to travel blind
and you know you can trust her
for shes touched your perfect body with her mindd

Alone Again (Naturally),Gilbert O'Sullivan,"oh in a little while from now
if im not feeling any less sour
i promised myself to treat myself
and visit a nearby tower
and climbing to the top
will throw myself off
in an effort to make it clear to whoever
what its like when youre shattered
left standing in the lurch at a church
where people saying
my god thats tough she stood him up
no point in us remaining
we may as well go home
as i did on my own
alone again naturally
to think that only yesterday
i was cheerful bright and gay
looking forward to well who wouldnt do
the role i was about to play
but as if to knock me down
reality came around
and without so much as a mere touch
cut me into little pieces
leaving me to doubt
talk about god in his mercy
for if he really does exist
why did he desert me
in my hour of need
i truly am indeed
e
alone again naturally
it seems to me that
there are more hearts
broken in the world
that cant be mended
left unattended
what do we do
what do we do
classical guitar solo
alone again naturally
now looking back over the years
and what ever else that appears
i remember i cried when my father died
never wishing to hide the tears
and at sixtyfive years old
my mother god rest her soul
couldnt understand why the only man
she had ever loved had been taken
leaving her to start with a heart
so badly broken
despite encouragement from me
no words were ever spoken
and when she passed away
i cried and cried all day
alone again naturally
alone again naturallyd

A Lover's Concerto,Sarah Vaughan,"how gentle is the rain
that falls softly on the meadow
birds high up in the trees
serenade the clouds with their melodies
oh see there beyond the hill
the bright colors of the rainbow
some magic from above
made this day for us just to fall in love
now i belong to you
from this day until forever
just love me tenderly
and ill give to you every part of me
oh dont ever make me cry
through long lonely nights without us
be always true to me
keep this day in your heart eternally
someday we shall return
to this place upon the meadow
well walk out in the rain
hear the birds above singing once again
oh youll hold me in your arms
and say once again you love me
and if your love is true
everything will be just as wonderful
eyoull hold me in your arms
and say once again you love me
and if your love is true
everything will be just as wonderful

and the line on the distance grows faint
so wide is my river the horizon a sliver

where the blue of the sea meets the sky
and the big yellow sun leads me home
im everywhere now the way is a vow
to the wind of each breath by and by

where the river runs deep and the larger fish creep
im glad of what keeps me afloat
the water sustains me without even trying
the water cant drown me im done
with my dying
now deeper the water i sail
and faster the current im in
that each night brings the stars and the song in my heart
is a tune for the journeymans tale
e
the water sustains me without even trying
the water cant drown me im done
with my dying
now the land that i knew is a dream
and the line on the distance grows faint
so wide is my river the horizon a sliver
the artist has run out of paint
where the blue of the sea meets the sky
and the big yellow sun leads me home
im everywhere now the way is a vow
to the wind of each breath by and by
the water sustains me without even trying
the water cant drown me im done
with my dyingd

Family Tree,Belle and Sebastian,"these crosses all over my body
remind me of who i used to be
give myself up to him in offering
let him make a woman out of me
im just a child but im not above violence
my mama raised me better than that
when the preacher talks that man demands his silence
and daddy said shoot first then run and dont look back
so take me down to the river and bathe me clean
put me on the back of your white horse to ride
all the way to th chapel let you wash all over m
ive killed before and ill kill again
take the noose off wrap it tight around my hand
they say heaven hath no fury like a woman scorned
and baby hell dont scare me ive been times before
so take me down to the river and bathe me clean
put me on the back of your white horse to ride
all the way to the chapel let you wash all over me

Who'd Have Known,Lily Allen,"its five oclock in the morning
conversation got boring
you said youd go into bed soon
so i snuck off to your bedroom
and i thought id just wait there
until i heard you come up the stairs
and i pretended i was sleeping
and i was hoping you would creep in with me
put your arm around my shoulder
and it was if the room got colder
and we moved closer in together
and started talking about the weather
you said tomorrow would be fun
and we could watch a place in the sun
i didnt know where this was going
when you kissed me
chorus 
are you mine are you mine
cause i stay here all the time
watching telly drinking wine
whod have known whod have known
when you flash up on my phone
i no longer feel alone no longer feel alone
e
i havent left you for days now
and im becoming amazed how
youre quite affectionate in public
in fact your friend said it made her feel sick
and even though its moving forward
theres just the right amount of awkward
and today you accidentally called me baby

are you mine are you mine
cause i stay here all the time
watching telly drinking wine
whod have known whod have known
when you flash up on my phone
i no longer feel alone no longer feel alone

for when the busy day goes by
a sad and lonely heart have i
night is my friend
long days i spent
and though i go from place to place
i seek and never find your face
night is my friend

for night in the end
will bring to me that peace of mind
and comfort where true lovers find
their dreams conserved
so night sweet lovely night
