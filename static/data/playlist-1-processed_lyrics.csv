Earthing and Protection,Pram,"i carry this torn world like a weight
in my heart
i nurse this infant world by day
in my arms
but when my love comes along
i find a haven in my eyes
and when my love comes along
i find a haven in his arms
at night i can be free to care for just two
the world is far away
and innocently blueed

I'll Be Seeing You,Billie Holiday,"ill be seeing you
in all the old familiar places
that this heart of mine embraces
all day and through
in that small caf
the park across the way
the childrens carousel
the chestnut trees the wishing well

in every lovely summers day
in everything thats light and gay
ill always think of you that way
ill find you in the morning sun
and when the night is new
ill be looking at the moon
but ill be seeing you
ill be seeing you
in every lovely summers day
in everything thats light and gay
ill always think of you that way
ill find you in the morning sun
and when the night is new
ill be looking at the moon
but ill be seeing youed

No One's Boy,Marcy Playground,"angel
you missed your chance
to be the prom queen
and so you turned
into a wet dream
star of your own video
late night show on the floor

as you slow move
to the rhythm
of this sweet sound
booming through the radio
late night show that they ignore
are you lonely
cause im no ones boy
im no ones boy
and ill be all you need
only if you plead
pray do

if youll be my girl
if youll be my girl
im no ones boy
im no ones boy
and ill be all you need
only if youll bleed
pray do
ehey hey dont walk away from me
i found you
i can find youd

Dramamine,Modest Mouse,"travelling swallowing dramamine
feeling spaced breathing out listerine
id said what id said that id tell ya
and that youd killed the better part of me
if you could just milk it for everything
ive said what id said and you know what i mean
but i still cant focus on anything
we kiss on the mouth but still cough down our sleeves
travelling swallowing dramamine
look at your face like youre killed in a dream
and you think youve figured out everything
i think i know my geography pretty damn well
you say what you need so youll get more
if you could just milk it for everything
ive said what i said and you know what i mean
but i still cant focus on anythingsee modest mouse liveget tickets as low as ed

all alone with my mind headed for a bounty
ive been living so long all by myself
i cant think of living with anybody else

Wonderful Tonight - Live,Eric Clapton,"its late in the evening shes wondering what clothes to wear
she puts on her makeup and brushes her long blonde hair
and then she asks me do i look all right
and i say yes you look wonderful tonight
we go to a party and everyone turns to see
this beautiful lady thats walking around with me
and then she asks me do you feel all right
and i say yes i feel wonderful tonight
i feel wonderful because i see
the love light in your eyes
and the wonder of it all
is that you just dont realize how much i love you
its time to go home now and ive got an aching head
so i give her the car keys and she helps me to bed
and then i tell her as i turn out the light
i say my darling you were wonderful tonight

You Sent Me Flying / Cherry,Amy Winehouse,"girls like me dont fall easily
we catch flights not feelings
we were raised on living freely
so how is this a heart
you were capable of stealing
girls like me
oh girls oh girls
oh girls like me
oh girls girls girls
times like these seem handmade for the two of us
nashville nights two headlights at the top of a hill
so how did it go from that to you saying this is it for us
you drove away like an easy play
beat me at my own game
so if youre really gonna say its nothing
throw me out of your life real fast
at least let me have the last laugh
girls like me dont like losing
something they thought they could win
you hurt my pride
sent me flying
eleaving town fast with the wind again
thought that this was different
but it ends up the same as usual
i wouldnt mind at all if you didnt act like
i was overstaying my welcome
the very same night
thats what im like
it doesnt mean i want a boyfriend
did you think you were a godsend
wheres the respect
i was your friend
i dont have hard feelings
but i still cried when you were leaving
so even though you know im lying
im always gonna carry on denying
you changed the game like you did
cause boys never do
i made a fool of myself running after you
i never run after anybody
thats what ill tell em
not after anybody
how you really gonna say its nothing its nothing
i felt something
but i dont like being left behind
you hurt my pride really sent me flying
i still cried when you were leavingd

Passage,Novo Amor,"on a dark desert highway
cool wind in my hair
warm smell of colitas
rising up through the air
up ahead in the distance
i saw a shimmering light
my head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
i had to stop for the night
there she stood in the doorway
i heard the mission bell
and i was thinkin to myself
this could be heaven or this could be hell
then she lit up a candle
and she showed me the way
there were voices down the corridor
i thought i heard them say
welcome to the hotel california
such a lovely place such a lovely place
such a lovely face
plenty of room at the hotel california
any time of year any time of year
you can find it here
see eagles liveget tickets as low as e
her mind is tiffanytwisted
she got the mercedes benz uh
she got a lot of pretty pretty boys
that she calls friends
how they dance in the courtyard
sweet summer sweat
some dance to remember
some dance to forget
so i called up the captain
please bring me my wine
he said we havent had that spirit here
since 
and still those voices are callin
from far away
wake you up in the middle of the night
just to hear them say
welcome to the hotel california
such a lovely place such a lovely place
such a lovely face
they livin it up at the hotel california
what a nice surprise what a nice surprise
bring your alibis
mirrors on the ceiling
the pink champagne on ice and she said
we are all just prisoners here
of our own device
and in the masters chambers
they gathered for the feast
they stab it with their steely knives
but they just cant kill the beast
last thing i remember i was
running for the door
i had to find the passage back
to the place i was before
relax said the night man
we are programmed to receive
you can check out any time you like
but you can never leave

Girl from the North Country,Bob Dylan,"if youre travelin in the north country fair

when the rivers freeze and summer ends

to keep her from the howling winds
please see if her hair hangs long
if it rolls and flows all down her breast
please see for me if her hairs hangin long

Why Can't I Come to You,Patty Waters,"why cant i come to you
take a chance that you might understand
why cant i talk to you
say the words that would make everything clear
about the way i feel toward you
its such a strong emotion
so new to me
about the way i feel inside
it must be love
it must be
love
but i dont have the strength
within myself to take a chance
that you might scorn me
so i must wait with hopeful heart
for you to look at me once more
and see your woman
you could always love
and with nothing more than feelings
know how very much she needs youed
