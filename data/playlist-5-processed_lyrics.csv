Littlest Things,Lily Allen,"sometimes i find myself sitting back and reminiscing
especially when i have to watch other people kissing
and i remember when you started calling me your missus
all the play fighting all the flirtatious disses
id tell you sad stories about my childhood
i dont know why i trusted you but i knew that i could
wed spend the whole weekend lying in our own dirt
i was just so happy in your boxers and your tshirt
prechorus
dreams dreams
of when we had just started things
dreams of you and me
and it seems it seems
that i cant shake those memories
i wonder if you have the same dreams too
the littlest things that take me there
i know it sounds lame but its so true
i know its not right but it seems unfair
that the things are reminding me of you
sometimes i wish we could just pretend
even if only for one weekend
so come on tell me
is this the end

drinking tea in bed watching dvds
when i discovered all your dirty grotty magazines
you take me out shopping and all wed buy is trainers
as if we ever needed anything to entertain us
the first time that you oduced me to your friends
and you could tell i was nervous so you held my hand
when i was feeling down you made that face you do
theres no one in the world who could replace you

Ecstasy (Apple of My Eye),Strawberry Switchblade,"in my darkest dreams i see
youre much closer now to me
i have got you in my hair
i can feel you round me everywhere
if i ever was to tell
i could talk of you so well
but youre here in me and will always be
the secret that i want to keep and
in a kiss lies so much more than touch
and my life has found a new temptation
and ecstasy has meaning once again
i find suddenly im closer to you
and i find all my wildest dreams
have come true
while i spin round
my heart is beating for two
and i am wishing
it will always be you and i
i will always come with you
doing all we want to do
seeing things weve never seen
going places we havent tried to be
etouching me and touching you
all the love we never knew
marked with x you see is our destiny
as we run together we could be so free
in a kiss lies so much more than touch
and my life has found a new temptation
and ecstasy has meaning once again
i find suddenly im closer to you
and i find all my wildest dreams
have come true

Child Psychology,Black Box Recorder,"spoken word
i stopped talking when i was six years old
i didnt want anything more to do with the outside world
i was happy being quiet
but of course they wouldnt leave me alone

they even tried bribery
i could have anything as long as i said it out loud

life is unfair

of course this episode didnt last forever
id made my point and it was time to move on
to peel away the next layer of deceit
and see what new surprises lay in store
my school report said i showed no interest
a disruptive influence
i felt sorry for them in a way
and when they finally expelled me
it didnt mean a thing

can you stick out your tongue

across the clear blue sky
