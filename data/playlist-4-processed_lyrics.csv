Slow Like Honey,Fiona Apple,"you moved like honey
in my dream last night
yeah some old fires were burning
you came near to me
and you endeared to me
but you couldnt quite discern me
does that scare you
ill let you run away
but your heart will not oblige you
youll remember me like a melody
yeah ill haunt the world inside you
and my big secret gonna win you over
slow like honey heavy with mood
ill let you see me
ill covet your regard
ill invade your demeanor
and youll yield to me
like a scent in the breeze
and youll wonder what it is about me
e
its my big secret keeping you coming
slow like honey heavy with mood
ah ah ahah ahah ah yeah
though dreams can be deceiving
like faces are to hearts
they serve for sweet relieving
when fantasy and reality lie too far apart
so i stretch myself across like a bridge
and i pull you to the edge
and stand there waiting
trying to attain
the end to satisfy the story
shall i release you
must i release you
as i rise to meet my glory
but my big secret
gonna hover over your life
gonna keep you reaching
when im gone like yesterday
when im high like heaven
when im strong like music
cause im slow like honey and heavy with moodd

Goodbye Evergreen,Sufjan Stevens,"goodbye evergreen

but everything heaven sent
must burn out in the end
i promised you

jump in my red little fox
and rivers running through it all
so kiss me as i am lost
kiss me from within
jump in my red little fox
yellow paper folded off
my love my queen my broken
dreams come save me
kiss me like the wind

kiss me like the wind
that flows within your veins

screaming words within
that spin without any cost
kiss me with the fire of gods

Man of a Thousand Faces,Regina Spektor,"the man of a thousand faces
sits down at the table
eats a small lump of sugar
and smiles at the moon like he knows her
he begins his quiet ascension
without anyones sturdy instruction
to a place of no religion
has found a path to our alikeness
his words are quiet like stains are
on a tablecloth washed in a river
stains that are trying to cover for each other
or at least blend in with the pattern
good is better than perfect
scrub till your fingers are bleeding
and im crying for things that
i tell others to do without crying
he used to go to his favorite bookstores
and rip out his favorite pages
and stuff em into his breast pocket
and the moon to him was a stranger
see regina spektor liveget tickets as low as e
now he sits down at a table
right next to the window
and begins his quiet ascension
without anyones sturdy instruction
to a place with no religion

Alameda,Elliott Smith,"you walk down alameda
shuffling your deck of trick cards over everyone
like some precious only son
face down bow to the champion
you walk down alameda
looking at the cracks in the sidewalk
thinking about your friends
how you maintain all them in a constant state of suspense
for your own protection over their affection
nobody broke your heart
you broke your own cause you cant finish what you start
walk down alameda
brushing off the nightmares you wish could plague me when im awake
so now you see your first mistake was thinking that you could relate
for one or two minutes she liked you
but the fix is in
e
youre all pretension i never pay attention
nobody broke your heart
you broke your own because you cant finish what you start
nobody broke your heart
you broke your own because you cant finish what you start
nobody broke your heart
you broke your own because you cant finish what you start
nobody broke your heart
if youre alone it must be you that wants to be apartd

the perfect place the perfect time
to take you somewhere we both want to go
a starry drive in mid july
park the car turn off the lights
and venture through a field out on our own

the birds they sang a melody
my heart was keeping time and we
were dancing on the edge of something new
slow at first but still it seems
that well go down in history
as lovers from the start just me and you
ive spent a thousand nights
lost in your emerald eyes
lost in a place where i know you can see my soul
make me lose track of time
you and your emerald eyes
finally found a place that i can call my home
a subtle breeze its you and me
chest to chest no in between
and every moments better than the last
anything and everything
that i could ever want and need
is standing right beside me in the grass

sur la branche du figuier

cest la porte qui se ferme
la voiture qui sen va
le silence qui sinstalle
mais bien vite tu reviens
et ma vie reprend son cours
le dernier bonheur du jour
cest la lampe qui steinted
