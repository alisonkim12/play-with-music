4 ContributorsEarthing and Protection LyricsI carry this torn world like a weight
In my heart
I nurse this infant world by day
In my arms

But when my love comes along
I find a haven in my eyes
And when my love comes along
I find a haven in his arms

At night I can be free to care for just two
The world is far away
And innocently blueYou might also likeEmbed
15 ContributorsI’ll Be Seeing You Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'll be seeing you
In all the old familiar places
That this heart of mine embraces
All day and through
In that small café
The park across the way
The children's carousel
The chestnut trees, the wishing well

[Verse 2]
I'll be seeing you
In every lovely summer's day
In everything that's light and gay
I'll always think of you that way
I'll find you in the morning sun
And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon
But I'll be seeing you

[Verse 3]
I'll be seeing you
In every lovely summer's day
In everything that's light and gay
I'll always think of you that way
I'll find you in the morning sun
And when the night is new
I'll be looking at the moon

2 ContributorsNo One’s Boy LyricsAngel
You missed your chance
To be the prom queen
And so you turned
Into a wet dream
Star of your own video
Late night show on the floor
A bad girl
No one's watching
As you slow move
To the rhythm
Of this sweet sound
Booming through the radio
Late night show that they ignore
Are you lonely

'Cause I'm no one's boy
I'm no one's boy
And I'll be all you need
Only if you plead
Pray do
Angel blue

If you'll be my girl
If you'll be my girl
I'm no one's boy
I'm no one's boy
And I'll be all you need
Only if you'll bleed
Pray do

44 ContributorsDramamine Lyrics[Verse 1]
Travelling, swallowing Dramamine
Feeling spaced, breathing out Listerine
I'd said what I'd said, that I'd tell ya
And that you'd killed the better part of me
If you could just milk it for everything
I've said what I'd said, and you know what I mean
But I still can't focus on anything
We kiss on the mouth but still cough down our sleeves

[Verse 2]
Travelling, swallowing Dramamine
Look at your face like you're killed in a dream
And you think you've figured out everything
I think I know my geography pretty damn well
You say what you need so you'll get more
If you could just milk it for everything
I've said what I said, and you know what I mean
But I still can't focus on anythingSee Modest Mouse LiveGet tickets as low as $72You might also like18Embed

If I ever get to see you again
I would never let you go, my friend
I would take away the rain (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
And put a smile upon your face
And I'd keep those teardrops from falling

[Verse 1]
I admit I've been running around
Looking for something new
Every city and every town
Baby, nothing compares to you
It gets so lonely on the road (Ooh-ooh)
Want someone to hold me in their arms (Ooh-ooh)
But it never feels as good (Ooh-ooh)
'Cause nothing, nothing, nothing compares to you

If I ever get to see you again
I would never let you go, my friend (Never let you go)

3 ContributorsWonderful Tonight (Live) LyricsIt's late in the evening, she's wondering what clothes to wear
She puts on her make-up and brushes her long blonde hair
And then she asks me, "Do I look all right?"
And I say, "Yes, you look wonderful tonight"

We go to a party and everyone turns to see
This beautiful lady that's walking around with me
And then she asks me, "Do you feel all right?"
And I say, "Yes, I feel wonderful tonight"

I feel wonderful because I see
The love light in your eyes
And the wonder of it all
Is that you just don't realize how much I love you

It's time to go home now and I've got an aching head
So I give her the car keys and she helps me to bed
And then I tell her, as I turn out the light
I say, "My darling, you were wonderful tonight
Oh my darling, you were wonderful tonight"See Eric Clapton LiveGet tickets as low as $70You might also likeEmbed
15 ContributorsImagining My Man Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm going to answer, protected
It can be so hard to forgive
It's not what I sought, and it's not what I pictured
When I was imagining my man
You are so nervous all of the time, living the classics
I know that imagining my man
Imagining, imagining my man

[Chorus]
All my life (Hey!) I've had to fight to stay
You were right, love takes time, hey, hey

[Verse 2]
You have this dream, apparently I'm not done
I leave and it's dreadful
If you get down
Be honest, respectful

[Chorus]
All my life (Hey!) I never tried to stay
You were right, love takes time, hey, hey

I hope one day we'll get that way
Lucky to be given the chance

I thought that the sun burned brighter
With you by my side
And that we'd go on forever

Leavin' you is hard for me
But I've gotta do what's right for me

I want made at home
I don't want advertisements on my telephone
Don't want formal letters, robo calls
Big box shopping malls

Formatted to fit your TV

Home on wheels
I want a lazy river

Don't want junk mail
Total waste

On a dark desert highway
Cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas
Rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance
I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night

[Verse 2]
There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinkin' to myself
"This could be Heaven or this could be Hell"
Then she lit up a candle
And she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say

[Chorus]
"Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (Any time of year)
You can find it here"

Her mind is Tiffany-twisted
She got the Mercedes Benz, uh
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys
That she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard
Sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember
Some dance to forget

[Verse 4]
So I called up the Captain
"Please bring me my wine"
He said, "We haven't had that spirit here
Since 1969"
And still those voices are callin'
From far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say

[Chorus]
"Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
They livin' it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise (What a nice surprise)
Bring your alibis"
[Verse 5]
Mirrors on the ceiling
The pink champagne on ice, and she said
"We are all just prisoners here
Of our own device"
And in the master's chambers
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast

[Verse 6]
Last thing I remember, I was
Running for the door
I had to find the passage back
To the place I was before
"Relax," said the night man
"We are programmed to receive
You can check out any time you like
But you can never leave"

If you’re travelin' in the north country fair
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
Remember me to one who lives there
For she once was a true love of mine

[Verse 2]
If you go when the snowflakes storm
When the rivers freeze and summer ends
Please see she has a coat so warm
To keep her from the howling winds

[Verse 3]
Please see if her hair hangs long
If it rolls and flows all down her breast
Please see for me if her hair's hangin' long
For that’s the way I remember her best

[Verse 4]
I’m a-wondering if she remembers me at all
Many times I’ve often prayed
In the darkness of my night
In the brightness of my day

1 ContributorWhy Can’t I Come To You LyricsWhy can't I come to you?
Take a chance that you might understand
Why can't I talk to you?
Say the words that would make everything clear
About the way I feel toward you

It's such a strong emotion
So new to me
About the way I feel inside

It must be love
It must be
Love

But I don't have the strength
Within myself, to take a chance
That you might scorn me
So I must wait, with hopeful heart
For you to look at me, once more

And see your woman
You could always love
And with nothing more than feelings
Know how very much she needs youYou might also likeEmbed
