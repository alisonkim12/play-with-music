Love is Won,Lia Ices,"o you know i need your mystic mind
for you are leading us towards the unblind
we know that magic is a part of life
love is won when we arent bound by time
when we have animals well start a tribe
youll be the shepherd as we all head towards the unblind
fell into the fault and now we feel too deep
o love is won when were bound and still feel free

so i can find the myth and let forever out

Autumn Song,Dorothy Carter,"i
shortly we will plunge within the frigid gloom
farewell swift summer brightness all too short
i hear already sounding with a deathlike boom
the wood that falls upon the pavement of the court
the whole of winter enters in my beingpain
hate honor labour hard and forcedand dread
and like the northern sun upon its polar plane
my heart will soon be but a stone iced and red
i listen trembling unto every log that falls
the scaffold which they build has not a duller sound
my spirits waver like the trembling tower walls
that shakewith every echoing blow the builders pound
meeseemethas to these monotonous blows i sway
they nail for one a coffin lid or sound a knell
for whom autumn nowand summer yesterday
this strange mysterious noise betokens a farewell
ii
i love within your oblong eyes the verdant rays
my sweet but bitter everything today meseems
and noughtyour love the boudoir nor the flickering blaze
can replace the sun that oer the screen streams
and yet bemother and caress me tender heart
even me the thankless and the worthless one
beloved or sisterunto me the sweets impart
of a glorious autumn or a sinking sun
ephemeral task the beckoning the beckoning empty tomb is set
oh grant meas upon your knees my head i lay
because the white and torrid summer i regret
to taste the parted seasons mild and amber rayd

Something On Your Mind,Karen Dalton,"yesterday any way you made it was just fine
so you turned your days into night time
didnt you know you cant make it without ever even trying
and somethings on your mind isnt it
let these times show you that youre breaking up the lines
leaving all your dreams too far behind
didnt you see you cant make it without ever even trying
and somethings on your mind
maybe another day youll want to feel another way you cant stop crying
you havent got a thing to say you feel you want to run away
theres no use trying anyway
ive seen the writing on the wall
who cannot maintain will always fall
well you know you cant make it without ever even trying
and somethings on your mind isnt it
tell the truth now isnt it
somethings on your mind isnt it
